## About
The get_next_line consists of creating a function that reads a file descriptor line by line and returns the next line each time it is called. The bonus part of this project requires altering the function so that it can handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously. This project aims to reinforce concepts such as memory management, file descriptors, and string manipulation. 

## Usage
#### 1st - Clone the repository
``` bash
git@github.com:MartimPinto/get_next_line.git get_next_line
```
#### 2nd - Enter the project folder and compile
``` bash
cd get_next_line/src

[Flags] -Wall -Wextra -Werror
[Mandatory] cc [Flags] main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
[Bonus] cc [Flags] main.c get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c
```

The main.c function is not included in this repository.

#### 3rd - Execution with one or multiple file descriptors/standard input
``` c
./a.out [text.txt]
./a.out [text1.txt] [text2.txt]
```
